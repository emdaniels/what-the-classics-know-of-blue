Book 44        Acts

44:001:001 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that
           Jesus began both to do and teach,

44:001:002 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
           the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom
           he had chosen:

44:001:003 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
           infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking
           of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:

44:001:004 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that
           they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
           promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.

44:001:005 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
           with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

44:001:006 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
           saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
           to Israel?

44:001:007 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or
           the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

44:001:008 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
           upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
           and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
           of the earth.

44:001:009 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
           taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

44:001:010 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
           behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;

44:001:011 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
           into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
           heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go
           into heaven.

44:001:012 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called
           Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

44:001:013 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
           where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,
           Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of
           Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.

44:001:014 These all continued with one accord in prayer and
           supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
           and with his brethren.

44:001:015 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the
           disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about
           an hundred and twenty,)

44:001:016 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
           fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
           before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took
           Jesus.

44:001:017 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
           ministry.

44:001:018 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;
           and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all
           his bowels gushed out.

44:001:019 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
           as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that
           is to say, The field of blood.

44:001:020 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
           desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let
           another take.

44:001:021 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the
           time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

44:001:022 Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he
           was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
           with us of his resurrection.

44:001:023 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was
           surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

44:001:024 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the
           hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,

44:001:025 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
           which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own
           place.

44:001:026 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon
           Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

44:002:001 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
           with one accord in one place.

44:002:002 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
           mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
           sitting.

44:002:003 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
           and it sat upon each of them.

44:002:004 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
           speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

44:002:005 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
           every nation under heaven.

44:002:006 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
           and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak
           in his own language.

44:002:007 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
           Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?

44:002:008 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
           born?

44:002:009 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
           Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and
           Asia,

44:002:010 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
           about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,

44:002:011 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the
           wonderful works of God.

44:002:012 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
           another, What meaneth this?

44:002:013 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.

44:002:014 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
           and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at
           Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:

44:002:015 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the
           third hour of the day.

44:002:016 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;

44:002:017 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will
           pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
           daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see
           visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:

44:002:018 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
           those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:

44:002:019 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the
           earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:

44:002:020 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
           blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:

44:002:021 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
           name of the Lord shall be saved.

44:002:022 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
           approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
           which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves
           also know:

44:002:023 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
           foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
           crucified and slain:

44:002:024 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
           because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.

44:002:025 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
           before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not
           be moved:

44:002:026 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
           moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:

44:002:027 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

44:002:028 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make
           me full of joy with thy countenance.

44:002:029 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
           patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his
           sepulchre is with us unto this day.

44:002:030 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with
           an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to
           the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;

44:002:031 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
           that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
           corruption.

44:002:032 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

44:002:033 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
           received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath
           shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.

44:002:034 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
           himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right
           hand,

44:002:035 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

44:002:036 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
           hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord
           and Christ.

44:002:037 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart,
           and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and
           brethren, what shall we do?

44:002:038 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
           of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
           and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

44:002:039 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
           that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall
           call.

44:002:040 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
           Save yourselves from this untoward generation.

44:002:041 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
           same day there were added unto them about three thousand
           souls.

44:002:042 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
           fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

44:002:043 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
           done by the apostles.

44:002:044 And all that believed were together, and had all things
           common;

44:002:045 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
           men, as every man had need.

44:002:046 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
           breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
           gladness and singleness of heart,

44:002:047 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
           Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

44:003:001 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
           hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.

44:003:002 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
           whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
           Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;

44:003:003 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an
           alms.

44:003:004 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
           on us.

44:003:005 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
           them.

44:003:006 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
           have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise
           up and walk.

44:003:007 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
           immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

44:003:008 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
           into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

44:003:009 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

44:003:010 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
           Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder
           and amazement at that which had happened unto him.

44:003:011 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all
           the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
           Solomon's, greatly wondering.

44:003:012 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
           Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on
           us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
           man to walk?

44:003:013 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
           fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up,
           and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was
           determined to let him go.

44:003:014 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a
           murderer to be granted unto you;

44:003:015 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
           dead; whereof we are witnesses.

44:003:016 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
           strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
           hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
           all.

44:003:017 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as
           did also your rulers.

44:003:018 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of
           all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so
           fulfilled.

44:003:019 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
           blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
           presence of the Lord.

44:003:020 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
           you:

44:003:021 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of
           all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
           prophets since the world began.

44:003:022 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the
           Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
           me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say
           unto you.

44:003:023 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not
           hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

44:003:024 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
           after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
           days.

44:003:025 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
           God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy
           seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

44:003:026 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
           to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
           iniquities.

44:004:001 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the
           captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

44:004:002 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached
           through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

44:004:003 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the
           next day: for it was now eventide.

44:004:004 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the
           number of the men was about five thousand.

44:004:005 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and
           elders, and scribes,

44:004:006 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
           Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high
           priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

44:004:007 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
           power, or by what name, have ye done this?

44:004:008 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
           rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

44:004:009 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the
           impotent man, by what means he is made whole;

44:004:010 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,
           that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye
           crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth
           this man stand here before you whole.

44:004:011 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
           which is become the head of the corner.

44:004:012 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
           other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
           saved.

44:004:013 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
           perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they
           marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been
           with Jesus.

44:004:014 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
           they could say nothing against it.

44:004:015 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the
           council, they conferred among themselves,

44:004:016 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a
           notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them
           that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

44:004:017 But that it spread no further among the people, let us
           straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man
           in this name.

44:004:018 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all
           nor teach in the name of Jesus.

44:004:019 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
           right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
           God, judge ye.

44:004:020 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
           heard.

44:004:021 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
           finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the
           people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.

44:004:022 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
           healing was shewed.

44:004:023 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
           all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

44:004:024 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God
           with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

44:004:025 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
           heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

44:004:026 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
           together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

44:004:027 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
           anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
           and the people of Israel, were gathered together,

44:004:028 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
           before to be done.

44:004:029 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
           servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,

44:004:030 By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and
           wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

44:004:031 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
           assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy
           Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

44:004:032 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
           of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things
           which he possessed was his own; but they had all things
           common.

44:004:033 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
           resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them
           all.

44:004:034 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as
           were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the
           prices of the things that were sold,

44:004:035 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was
           made unto every man according as he had need.

44:004:036 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which
           is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and
           of the country of Cyprus,

44:004:037 Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at
           the apostles' feet.

44:005:001 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold
           a possession,

44:005:002 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to
           it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles'
           feet.

44:005:003 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to
           lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of
           the land?

44:005:004 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was
           sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived
           this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but
           unto God.

44:005:005 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the
           ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these
           things.

44:005:006 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out,
           and buried him.

44:005:007 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his
           wife, not knowing what was done, came in.

44:005:008 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land
           for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.

44:005:009 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed
           together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of
           them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall
           carry thee out.

44:005:010 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
           ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and,
           carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.

44:005:011 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
           heard these things.

44:005:012 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
           wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord
           in Solomon's porch.

44:005:013 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
           people magnified them.

44:005:014 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both
           of men and women.)

44:005:015 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
           and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the
           shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

44:005:016 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
           Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with
           unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.

44:005:017 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
           (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
           indignation,

44:005:018 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the
           common prison.

44:005:019 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors,
           and brought them forth, and said,

44:005:020 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words
           of this life.

44:005:021 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early
           in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they
           that were with him, and called the council together, and all
           the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison
           to have them brought.

44:005:022 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
           they returned and told,

44:005:023 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and
           the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had
           opened, we found no man within.

44:005:024 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
           chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them
           whereunto this would grow.

44:005:025 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye
           put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the
           people.

44:005:026 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
           without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should
           have been stoned.

44:005:027 And when they had brought them, they set them before the
           council: and the high priest asked them,

44:005:028 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not
           teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with
           your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

44:005:029 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
           to obey God rather than men.

44:005:030 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and
           hanged on a tree.

44:005:031 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
           Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of
           sins.

44:005:032 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
           Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

44:005:033 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
           counsel to slay them.

44:005:034 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
           Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the
           people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little
           space;

44:005:035 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
           what ye intend to do as touching these men.

44:005:036 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
           somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
           themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,
           were scattered, and brought to nought.

44:005:037 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
           taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished;
           and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

44:005:038 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
           alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will
           come to nought:

44:005:039 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be
           found even to fight against God.

44:005:040 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
           and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in
           the name of Jesus, and let them go.

44:005:041 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
           that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

44:005:042 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not
           to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

44:006:001 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
           multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against
           the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily
           ministration.

44:006:002 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto
           them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word
           of God, and serve tables.

44:006:003 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
           report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint
           over this business.

44:006:004 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
           ministry of the word.

44:006:005 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
           Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and
           Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas,
           and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:

44:006:006 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed,
           they laid their hands on them.

44:006:007 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
           multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the
           priests were obedient to the faith.

44:006:008 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
           miracles among the people.

44:006:009 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
           synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians,
           and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

44:006:010 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
           which he spake.

44:006:011 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
           blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.

44:006:012 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the
           scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to
           the council,

44:006:013 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
           to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the
           law:

44:006:014 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
           destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses
           delivered us.

44:006:015 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him,
           saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

44:007:001 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

44:007:002 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of
           glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in
           Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,

44:007:003 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
           kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

44:007:004 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
           Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed
           him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

44:007:005 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to
           set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him
           for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he
           had no child.

44:007:006 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
           strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
           and entreat them evil four hundred years.

44:007:007 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge,
           said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me
           in this place.

44:007:008 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham
           begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac
           begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.

44:007:009 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt:
           but God was with him,

44:007:010 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him
           favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and
           he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

44:007:011 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and
           Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no
           sustenance.

44:007:012 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
           our fathers first.

44:007:013 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren;
           and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

44:007:014 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all
           his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

44:007:015 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,

44:007:016 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
           that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor
           the father of Sychem.

44:007:017 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had
           sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

44:007:018 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.

44:007:019 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated
           our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to
           the end they might not live.

44:007:020 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
           nourished up in his father's house three months:

44:007:021 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and
           nourished him for her own son.

44:007:022 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
           was mighty in words and in deeds.

44:007:023 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart
           to visit his brethren the children of Israel.

44:007:024 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and
           avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:

44:007:025 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that
           God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.

44:007:026 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove,
           and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are
           brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?

44:007:027 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying,
           Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

44:007:028 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

44:007:029 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land
           of Madian, where he begat two sons.

44:007:030 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in
           the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame
           of fire in a bush.

44:007:031 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew
           near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,

44:007:032 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and
           the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled,
           and durst not behold.

44:007:033 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet:
           for the place where thou standest is holy ground.

44:007:034 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is
           in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to
           deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

44:007:035 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler
           and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a
           deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in
           the bush.

44:007:036 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and
           signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the
           wilderness forty years.

44:007:037 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
           prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
           brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.

44:007:038 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
           angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our
           fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:

44:007:039 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them,
           and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,

44:007:040 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for
           this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot
           not what is become of him.

44:007:041 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
           the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

44:007:042 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of
           heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye
           house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and
           sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?

44:007:043 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your
           god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will
           carry you away beyond Babylon.

44:007:044 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
           as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make
           it according to the fashion that he had seen.

44:007:045 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus
           into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before
           the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;

44:007:046 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle
           for the God of Jacob.

44:007:047 But Solomon built him an house.

44:007:048 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
           as saith the prophet,

44:007:049 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house
           will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my
           rest?

44:007:050 Hath not my hand made all these things?

44:007:051 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
           always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.

44:007:052 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and
           they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the
           Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and
           murderers:

44:007:053 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and
           have not kept it.

44:007:054 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
           they gnashed on him with their teeth.

44:007:055 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
           into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on
           the right hand of God,

44:007:056 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
           standing on the right hand of God.

44:007:057 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
           and ran upon him with one accord,

44:007:058 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the
           witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
           name was Saul.

44:007:059 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
           Jesus, receive my spirit.

44:007:060 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
           not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he
           fell asleep.

44:008:001 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
           was a great persecution against the church which was at
           Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the
           regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

44:008:002 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
           lamentation over him.

44:008:003 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
           house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

44:008:004 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
           preaching the word.

44:008:005 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
           Christ unto them.

44:008:006 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
           which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he
           did.

44:008:007 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
           that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies,
           and that were lame, were healed.

44:008:008 And there was great joy in that city.

44:008:009 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in
           the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of
           Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

44:008:010 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
           saying, This man is the great power of God.

44:008:011 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
           bewitched them with sorceries.

44:008:012 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
           the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were
           baptized, both men and women.

44:008:013 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
           continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles
           and signs which were done.

44:008:014 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that
           Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them
           Peter and John:

44:008:015 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they
           might receive the Holy Ghost:

44:008:016 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
           baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

44:008:017 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
           Ghost.

44:008:018 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles'
           hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

44:008:019 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay
           hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

44:008:020 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
           thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
           money.

44:008:021 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart
           is not right in the sight of God.

44:008:022 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if
           perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

44:008:023 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
           the bond of iniquity.

44:008:024 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me,
           that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

44:008:025 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
           Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many
           villages of the Samaritans.

44:008:026 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise,
           and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from
           Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.

44:008:027 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
           eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the
           Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had
           come to Jerusalem for to worship,

44:008:028 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
           prophet.

44:008:029 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
           this chariot.

44:008:030 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
           Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?

44:008:031 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And
           he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

44:008:032 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led
           as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his
           shearer, so opened he not his mouth:

44:008:033 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
           declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

44:008:034 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
           speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?

44:008:035 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
           and preached unto him Jesus.

44:008:036 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
           and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me
           to be baptized?

44:008:037 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
           mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ
           is the Son of God.

44:008:038 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
           down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
           baptized him.

44:008:039 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
           Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and
           he went on his way rejoicing.

44:008:040 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he
           preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

44:009:001 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
           the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

44:009:002 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that
           if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
           he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

44:009:003 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
           shined round about him a light from heaven:

44:009:004 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
           Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

44:009:005 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus
           whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the
           pricks.

44:009:006 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
           have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into
           the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

44:009:007 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing
           a voice, but seeing no man.

44:009:008 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
           he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him
           into Damascus.

44:009:009 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
           drink.

44:009:010 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
           and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said,
           Behold, I am here, Lord.

44:009:011 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street
           which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas
           for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

44:009:012 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and
           putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.

44:009:013 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
           how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

44:009:014 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all
           that call on thy name.

44:009:015 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
           vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and
           kings, and the children of Israel:

44:009:016 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my
           name's sake.

44:009:017 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
           putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even
           Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath
           sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled
           with the Holy Ghost.

44:009:018 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been
           scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
           baptized.

44:009:019 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was
           Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.

44:009:020 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he
           is the Son of God.

44:009:021 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he
           that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
           and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them
           bound unto the chief priests?

44:009:022 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the
           Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very
           Christ.

44:009:023 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel
           to kill him:

44:009:024 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the
           gates day and night to kill him.

44:009:025 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
           wall in a basket.

44:009:026 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join
           himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and
           believed not that he was a disciple.

44:009:027 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
           declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and
           that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at
           Damascus in the name of Jesus.

44:009:028 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

44:009:029 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
           disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay
           him.

44:009:030 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to
           Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

44:009:031 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee
           and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the
           Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

44:009:032 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters,
           he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

44:009:033 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept
           his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

44:009:034 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee
           whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

44:009:035 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to
           the Lord.

44:009:036 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which
           by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of
           good works and almsdeeds which she did.

44:009:037 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and
           died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper
           chamber.

44:009:038 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples
           had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men,
           desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.

44:009:039 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
           brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood
           by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which
           Dorcas made, while she was with them.

44:009:040 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
           and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she
           opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

44:009:041 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
           called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

44:009:042 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in
           the Lord.

44:009:043 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with
           one Simon a tanner.

44:010:001 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a
           centurion of the band called the Italian band,

44:010:002 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house,
           which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

44:010:003 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
           an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him,
           Cornelius.

44:010:004 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is
           it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are
           come up for a memorial before God.

44:010:005 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
           surname is Peter:

44:010:006 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea
           side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

44:010:007 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
           called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of
           them that waited on him continually;

44:010:008 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent
           them to Joppa.

44:010:009 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
           unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about
           the sixth hour:

44:010:010 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
           they made ready, he fell into a trance,

44:010:011 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon
           him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners,
           and let down to the earth:

44:010:012 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
           wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

44:010:013 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

44:010:014 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
           that is common or unclean.

44:010:015 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
           hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

44:010:016 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
           into heaven.

44:010:017 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he
           had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
           Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
           the gate,

44:010:018 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
           were lodged there.

44:010:019 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
           Behold, three men seek thee.

44:010:020 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
           nothing: for I have sent them.

44:010:021 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
           Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the
           cause wherefore ye are come?

44:010:022 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one
           that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of
           the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for
           thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.

44:010:023 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow
           Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa
           accompanied him.

44:010:024 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
           waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and
           near friends.

44:010:025 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down
           at his feet, and worshipped him.

44:010:026 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a
           man.

44:010:027 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that
           were come together.

44:010:028 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
           thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto
           one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should
           not call any man common or unclean.

44:010:029 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
           sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?

44:010:030 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this
           hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold,
           a man stood before me in bright clothing,

44:010:031 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are
           had in remembrance in the sight of God.

44:010:032 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname
           is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by
           the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

44:010:033 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
           that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present
           before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

44:010:034 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
           that God is no respecter of persons:

44:010:035 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
           righteousness, is accepted with him.

44:010:036 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
           peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

44:010:037 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all
           Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John
           preached;

44:010:038 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
           with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that
           were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

44:010:039 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
           land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged
           on a tree:

44:010:040 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

44:010:041 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God,
           even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from
           the dead.

44:010:042 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
           that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of
           quick and dead.

44:010:043 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
           whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

44:010:044 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
           them which heard the word.

44:010:045 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
           as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also
           was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

44:010:046 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
           answered Peter,

44:010:047 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
           which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

44:010:048 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
           Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

44:011:001 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that
           the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

44:011:002 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
           circumcision contended with him,

44:011:003 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
           with them.

44:011:004 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and
           expounded it by order unto them, saying,

44:011:005 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
           vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great
           sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even
           to me:

44:011:006 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
           and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
           creeping things, and fowls of the air.

44:011:007 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
           eat.

44:011:008 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
           at any time entered into my mouth.

44:011:009 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
           cleansed, that call not thou common.

44:011:010 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
           into heaven.

44:011:011 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
           unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

44:011:012 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.
           Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered
           into the man's house:

44:011:013 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
           stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for
           Simon, whose surname is Peter;

44:011:014 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
           shall be saved.

44:011:015 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
           at the beginning.

44:011:016 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
           indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the
           Holy Ghost.

44:011:017 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto
           us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I
           could withstand God?

44:011:018 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and
           glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles
           granted repentance unto life.

44:011:019 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
           arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus,
           and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews
           only.

44:011:020 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
           they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching
           the LORD Jesus.

44:011:021 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
           believed, and turned unto the Lord.

44:011:022 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
           which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he
           should go as far as Antioch.

44:011:023 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
           and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
           cleave unto the Lord.

44:011:024 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of
           faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.

44:011:025 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

44:011:026 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it
           came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
           the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were
           called Christians first in Antioch.

44:011:027 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

44:011:028 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
           the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all
           the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

44:011:029 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
           determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
           Judaea:

44:011:030 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
           Barnabas and Saul.

44:012:001 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands
           to vex certain of the church.

44:012:002 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

44:012:003 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
           to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)

44:012:004 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
           delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;
           intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

44:012:005 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
           without ceasing of the church unto God for him.

44:012:006 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
           Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
           chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.

44:012:007 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
           shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and
           raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell
           off from his hands.

44:012:008 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
           sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy
           garment about thee, and follow me.

44:012:009 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
           true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

44:012:010 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
           unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
           them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on
           through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.

44:012:011 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
           surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered
           me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of
           the people of the Jews.

44:012:012 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
           Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many
           were gathered together praying.

44:012:013 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
           hearken, named Rhoda.

44:012:014 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
           gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the
           gate.

44:012:015 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
           affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

44:012:016 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the
           door, and saw him, they were astonished.

44:012:017 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
           declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the
           prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to
           the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.

44:012:018 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
           soldiers, what was become of Peter.

44:012:019 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
           examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
           death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there
           abode.

44:012:020 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
           but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus
           the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because
           their country was nourished by the king's country.

44:012:021 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon
           his throne, and made an oration unto them.

44:012:022 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
           and not of a man.

44:012:023 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he
           gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up
           the ghost.

44:012:024 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

44:012:025 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
           fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose
           surname was Mark.

44:013:001 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain
           prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called
           Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been
           brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

44:013:002 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
           said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I
           have called them.

44:013:003 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
           them, they sent them away.

44:013:004 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
           Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

44:013:005 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God
           in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their
           minister.

44:013:006 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they
           found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name
           was Barjesus:

44:013:007 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
           prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to
           hear the word of God.

44:013:008 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
           withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the
           faith.

44:013:009 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy
           Ghost, set his eyes on him.

44:013:010 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child
           of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not
           cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

44:013:011 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
           shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
           immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he
           went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

44:013:012 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
           astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

44:013:013 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
           Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to
           Jerusalem.

44:013:014 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
           Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
           sat down.

44:013:015 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers
           of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren,
           if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

44:013:016 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
           Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

44:013:017 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and
           exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of
           Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.

44:013:018 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
           the wilderness.

44:013:019 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of
           Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.

44:013:020 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of
           four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

44:013:021 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
           the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space
           of forty years.

44:013:022 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to
           be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said,
           I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own
           heart, which shall fulfil all my will.

44:013:023 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised
           unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

44:013:024 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
           repentance to all the people of Israel.

44:013:025 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that
           I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me,
           whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.

44:013:026 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
           whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this
           salvation sent.

44:013:027 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because
           they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which
           are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in
           condemning him.

44:013:028 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired
           they Pilate that he should be slain.

44:013:029 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
           took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

44:013:030 But God raised him from the dead:

44:013:031 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from
           Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

44:013:032 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
           which was made unto the fathers,

44:013:033 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he
           hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the
           second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

44:013:034 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
           more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will
           give you the sure mercies of David.

44:013:035 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

44:013:036 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will
           of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw
           corruption:

44:013:037 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

44:013:038 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
           this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:

44:013:039 And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
           from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

44:013:040 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of
           in the prophets;

44:013:041 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a
           work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe,
           though a man declare it unto you.

44:013:042 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
           besought that these words might be preached to them the next
           sabbath.

44:013:043 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
           religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking
           to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44:013:044 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
           to hear the word of God.

44:013:045 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
           envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by
           Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

44:013:046 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
           that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but
           seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
           everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

44:013:047 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to
           be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
           salvation unto the ends of the earth.

44:013:048 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and
           glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained
           to eternal life believed.

44:013:049 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
           region.

44:013:050 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
           the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul
           and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.

44:013:051 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
           came unto Iconium.

44:013:052 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy
           Ghost.

44:014:001 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together
           into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great
           multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

44:014:002 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
           their minds evil affected against the brethren.

44:014:003 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
           which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted
           signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

44:014:004 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with
           the Jews, and part with the apostles.

44:014:005 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and
           also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully,
           and to stone them,

44:014:006 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities
           of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

44:014:007 And there they preached the gospel.

44:014:008 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
           being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:

44:014:009 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
           perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

44:014:010 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
           leaped and walked.

44:014:011 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
           their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are
           come down to us in the likeness of men.

44:014:012 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,
           because he was the chief speaker.

44:014:013 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city,
           brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done
           sacrifice with the people.

44:014:014 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
           rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

44:014:015 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
           like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should
           turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made
           heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are
           therein:

44:014:016 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
           ways.

44:014:017 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he
           did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
           filling our hearts with food and gladness.

44:014:018 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
           they had not done sacrifice unto them.

44:014:019 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
           who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out
           of the city, supposing he had been dead.

44:014:020 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up,
           and came into the city: and the next day he departed with
           Barnabas to Derbe.

44:014:021 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
           taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium,
           and Antioch,

44:014:022 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to
           continue in the faith, and that we must through much
           tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

44:014:023 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and
           had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
           whom they believed.

44:014:024 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
           Pamphylia.

44:014:025 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
           into Attalia:

44:014:026 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been
           recommended to the grace of God for the work which they
           fulfilled.

44:014:027 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
           they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had
           opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

44:014:028 And there they abode long time with the disciples.

44:015:001 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the
           brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner
           of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

44:015:002 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
           disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas,
           and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the
           apostles and elders about this question.

44:015:003 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed
           through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the
           Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.

44:015:004 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
           the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared
           all things that God had done with them.

44:015:005 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
           believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and
           to command them to keep the law of Moses.

44:015:006 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
           this matter.

44:015:007 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
           said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good
           while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my
           mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

44:015:008 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
           them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;

44:015:009 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
           hearts by faith.

44:015:010 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
           the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to
           bear?

44:015:011 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
           we shall be saved, even as they.

44:015:012 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
           Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
           wrought among the Gentiles by them.

44:015:013 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,
           Men and brethren, hearken unto me:

44:015:014 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
           Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

44:015:015 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

44:015:016 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle
           of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the
           ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

44:015:017 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the
           Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who
           doeth all these things.

44:015:018 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
           world.

44:015:019 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
           among the Gentiles are turned to God:

44:015:020 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions
           of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and
           from blood.

44:015:021 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
           being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

44:015:022 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
           to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul
           and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief
           men among the brethren:

44:015:023 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles
           and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which
           are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

44:015:024 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from
           us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
           saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we
           gave no such commandment:

44:015:025 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
           send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

44:015:026 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
           Jesus Christ.

44:015:027 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
           you the same things by mouth.

44:015:028 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
           you no greater burden than these necessary things;

44:015:029 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
           and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if
           ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

44:015:030 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when
           they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
           epistle:

44:015:031 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

44:015:032 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
           the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.

44:015:033 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
           peace from the brethren unto the apostles.

44:015:034 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

44:015:035 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
           preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

44:015:036 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
           and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached
           the word of the LORD, and see how they do.

44:015:037 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
           was Mark.

44:015:038 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
           from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

44:015:039 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they
           departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took
           Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;

44:015:040 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
           brethren unto the grace of God.

44:015:041 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
           churches.

44:016:001 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain
           disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain
           woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a
           Greek:

44:016:002 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra
           and Iconium.

44:016:003 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
           circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those
           quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.

44:016:004 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
           decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and
           elders which were at Jerusalem.

44:016:005 And so were the churches established in the faith, and
           increased in number daily.

44:016:006 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
           Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the
           word in Asia,

44:016:007 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
           Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

44:016:008 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

44:016:009 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
           of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
           Macedonia, and help us.

44:016:010 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
           to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had
           called us for to preach the gospel unto them.

44:016:011 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
           to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;

44:016:012 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
           part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city
           abiding certain days.

44:016:013 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
           where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake
           unto the women which resorted thither.

44:016:014 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
           city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart
           the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
           spoken of Paul.

44:016:015 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
           saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come
           into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

44:016:016 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
           possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought
           her masters much gain by soothsaying:

44:016:017 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men
           are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the
           way of salvation.

44:016:018 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned
           and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus
           Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

44:016:019 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was
           gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the
           marketplace unto the rulers,

44:016:020 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being
           Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,

44:016:021 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,
           neither to observe, being Romans.

44:016:022 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
           magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat
           them.

44:016:023 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
           into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

44:016:024 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
           prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

44:016:025 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
           God: and the prisoners heard them.

44:016:026 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
           foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
           doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.

44:016:027 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
           seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would
           have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been
           fled.

44:016:028 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
           for we are all here.

44:016:029 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
           and fell down before Paul and Silas,

44:016:030 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
           saved?

44:016:031 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
           shalt be saved, and thy house.

44:016:032 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
           were in his house.

44:016:033 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
           stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

44:016:034 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat
           before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his
           house.

44:016:035 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants,
           saying, Let those men go.

44:016:036 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
           magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and
           go in peace.

44:016:037 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly
           uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and
           now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them
           come themselves and fetch us out.

44:016:038 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
           they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

44:016:039 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
           desired them to depart out of the city.

44:016:040 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
           Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
           them, and departed.

44:017:001 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
           they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:

44:017:002 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
           sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

44:017:003 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
           and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I
           preach unto you, is Christ.

44:017:004 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
           and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
           women not a few.

44:017:005 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
           them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a
           company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the
           house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.

44:017:006 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
           brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have
           turned the world upside down are come hither also;

44:017:007 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
           decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one
           Jesus.

44:017:008 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
           they heard these things.

44:017:009 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
           they let them go.

44:017:010 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
           unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the
           Jews.

44:017:011 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
           received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
           scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

44:017:012 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
           which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

44:017:013 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
           of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
           and stirred up the people.

44:017:014 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
           were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

44:017:015 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
           receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come
           to him with all speed, they departed.

44:017:016 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
           stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

44:017:017 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
           the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met
           with him.

44:017:018 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the
           Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this
           babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of
           strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the
           resurrection.

44:017:019 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
           we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?

44:017:020 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
           know therefore what these things mean.

44:017:021 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
           their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear
           some new thing.)

44:017:022 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men
           of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
           superstitious.

44:017:023 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
           altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom
           therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

44:017:024 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
           is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
           hands;

44:017:025 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
           any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
           things;

44:017:026 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
           all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
           before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;

44:017:027 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
           him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:

44:017:028 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
           also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
           offspring.

44:017:029 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
           think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
           graven by art and man's device.

44:017:030 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
           commandeth all men every where to repent:

44:017:031 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
           the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;
           whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
           raised him from the dead.

44:017:032 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
           mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this
           matter.

44:017:033 So Paul departed from among them.

44:017:034 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
           which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
           and others with them.

44:018:001 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
           Corinth;

44:018:002 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
           come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that
           Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came
           unto them.

44:018:003 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
           wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

44:018:004 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
           the Jews and the Greeks.

44:018:005 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
           was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that
           Jesus was Christ.

44:018:006 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
           raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own
           heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the
           Gentiles.

44:018:007 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's
           house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house
           joined hard to the synagogue.

44:018:008 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
           Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing
           believed, and were baptized.

44:018:009 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
           afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

44:018:010 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:
           for I have much people in this city.

44:018:011 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the
           word of God among them.

44:018:012 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
           insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to
           the judgment seat,

44:018:013 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to
           the law.

44:018:014 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said
           unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked
           lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

44:018:015 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law,
           look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.

44:018:016 And he drave them from the judgment seat.

44:018:017 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
           synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio
           cared for none of those things.

44:018:018 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
           took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria,
           and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in
           Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

44:018:019 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
           entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

44:018:020 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
           consented not;

44:018:021 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
           feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto
           you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

44:018:022 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted
           the church, he went down to Antioch.

44:018:023 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
           over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
           strengthening all the disciples.

44:018:024 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
           eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

44:018:025 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
           fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the
           things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

44:018:026 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when
           Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and
           expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

44:018:027 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
           wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he
           was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

44:018:028 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly,
           shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

44:019:001 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
           having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and
           finding certain disciples,

44:019:002 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
           believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard
           whether there be any Holy Ghost.

44:019:003 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And
           they said, Unto John's baptism.

44:019:004 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
           repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe
           on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

44:019:005 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
           Lord Jesus.

44:019:006 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost
           came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

44:019:007 And all the men were about twelve.

44:019:008 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
           of three months, disputing and persuading the things
           concerning the kingdom of God.

44:019:009 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake
           evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them,
           and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of
           one Tyrannus.

44:019:010 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
           which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both
           Jews and Greeks.

44:019:011 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:

44:019:012 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
           or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil
           spirits went out of them.

44:019:013 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
           to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD
           Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

44:019:014 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of
           the priests, which did so.

44:019:015 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
           I know; but who are ye?

44:019:016 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
           overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled
           out of that house naked and wounded.

44:019:017 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
           Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
           Jesus was magnified.

44:019:018 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
           deeds.

44:019:019 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
           together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the
           price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

44:019:020 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

44:019:021 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
           when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to
           Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see
           Rome.

44:019:022 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto
           him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for
           a season.

44:019:023 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.

44:019:024 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
           silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the
           craftsmen;

44:019:025 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
           and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

44:019:026 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but
           almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and
           turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which
           are made with hands:

44:019:027 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
           nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
           should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed,
           whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.

44:019:028 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath,
           and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

44:019:029 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having
           caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's
           companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the
           theatre.

44:019:030 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
           disciples suffered him not.

44:019:031 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
           unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself
           into the theatre.

44:019:032 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
           assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore
           they were come together.

44:019:033 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
           him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would
           have made his defence unto the people.

44:019:034 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
           the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the
           Ephesians.

44:019:035 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye
           men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that
           the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess
           Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?

44:019:036 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
           ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

44:019:037 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither
           robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.

44:019:038 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
           have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
           deputies: let them implead one another.

44:019:039 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
           be determined in a lawful assembly.

44:019:040 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
           uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of
           this concourse.

44:019:041 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

44:020:001 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
           disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into
           Macedonia.

44:020:002 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
           exhortation, he came into Greece,

44:020:003 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for
           him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return
           through Macedonia.

44:020:004 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
           the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of
           Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

44:020:005 These going before tarried for us at Troas.

44:020:006 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
           bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we
           abode seven days.

44:020:007 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
           together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to
           depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

44:020:008 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
           were gathered together.

44:020:009 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
           being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long
           preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the
           third loft, and was taken up dead.

44:020:010 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
           Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

44:020:011 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
           eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
           departed.

44:020:012 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
           comforted.

44:020:013 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
           intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding
           himself to go afoot.

44:020:014 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
           Mitylene.

44:020:015 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against
           Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at
           Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.

44:020:016 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
           not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
           for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

44:020:017 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
           the church.

44:020:018 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
           from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
           have been with you at all seasons,

44:020:019 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many
           tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait
           of the Jews:

44:020:020 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but
           have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house
           to house,

44:020:021 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
           repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

44:020:022 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
           knowing the things that shall befall me there:

44:020:023 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
           bonds and afflictions abide me.

44:020:024 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
           unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
           the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
           testify the gospel of the grace of God.

44:020:025 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
           preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

44:020:026 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
           the blood of all men.

44:020:027 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
           God.

44:020:028 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
           over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
           the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

44:020:029 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
           enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

44:020:030 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
           things, to draw away disciples after them.

44:020:031 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
           years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

44:020:032 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
           his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
           inheritance among all them which are sanctified.

44:020:033 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

44:020:034 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
           my necessities, and to them that were with me.

44:020:035 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought
           to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord
           Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to
           receive.

44:020:036 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
           them all.

44:020:037 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed
           him,

44:020:038 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
           should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the
           ship.

44:021:001 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and
           had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and
           the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

44:021:002 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,
           and set forth.

44:021:003 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left
           hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the
           ship was to unlade her burden.

44:021:004 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
           to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to
           Jerusalem.

44:021:005 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
           our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and
           children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on
           the shore, and prayed.

44:021:006 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
           and they returned home again.

44:021:007 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
           Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one
           day.

44:021:008 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
           came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip
           the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with
           him.

44:021:009 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did
           prophesy.

44:021:010 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea
           a certain prophet, named Agabus.

44:021:011 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
           his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost,
           So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this
           girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

44:021:012 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
           place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

44:021:013 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
           heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
           Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

44:021:014 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The
           will of the Lord be done.

44:021:015 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
           Jerusalem.

44:021:016 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
           and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple,
           with whom we should lodge.

44:021:017 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
           gladly.

44:021:018 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
           the elders were present.

44:021:019 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
           things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

44:021:020 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
           him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are
           which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:

44:021:021 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
           which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
           they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk
           after the customs.

44:021:022 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
           for they will hear that thou art come.

44:021:023 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
           have a vow on them;

44:021:024 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges
           with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know
           that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
           are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and
           keepest the law.

44:021:025 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
           concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they
           keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood,
           and from strangled, and from fornication.

44:021:026 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
           with them entered into the temple, to signify the
           accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an
           offering should be offered for every one of them.

44:021:027 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
           of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
           people, and laid hands on him,

44:021:028 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that
           teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law,
           and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the
           temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

44:021:029 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
           Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the
           temple.)

44:021:030 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
           they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith
           the doors were shut.

44:021:031 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
           chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an
           uproar.

44:021:032 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
           unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the
           soldiers, they left beating of Paul.

44:021:033 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
           him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and
           what he had done.

44:021:034 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
           and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he
           commanded him to be carried into the castle.

44:021:035 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
           of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

44:021:036 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
           with him.

44:021:037 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
           chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou
           speak Greek?

44:021:038 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
           uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men
           that were murderers?

44:021:039 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in
           Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee,
           suffer me to speak unto the people.

44:021:040 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
           and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
           made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue,
           saying,

44:022:001 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make
           now unto you.

44:022:002 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to
           them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)

44:022:003 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in
           Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
           and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the
           fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.

44:022:004 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and
           delivering into prisons both men and women.

44:022:005 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the
           estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto
           the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were
           there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.

44:022:006 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
           nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from
           heaven a great light round about me.

44:022:007 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
           Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

44:022:008 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am
           Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

44:022:009 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
           afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

44:022:010 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
           Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee
           of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

44:022:011 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
           led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into
           Damascus.

44:022:012 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
           good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,

44:022:013 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul,
           receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

44:022:014 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that
           thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and
           shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.

44:022:015 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
           seen and heard.

44:022:016 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
           away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

44:022:017 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
           even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;

44:022:018 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly
           out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony
           concerning me.

44:022:019 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
           every synagogue them that believed on thee:

44:022:020 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
           standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
           raiment of them that slew him.

44:022:021 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
           unto the Gentiles.

44:022:022 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
           their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the
           earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

44:022:023 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
           dust into the air,

44:022:024 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle,
           and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he
           might know wherefore they cried so against him.

44:022:025 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
           centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
           that is a Roman, and uncondemned?

44:022:026 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief
           captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a
           Roman.

44:022:027 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
           thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

44:022:028 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I
           this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

44:022:029 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
           examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he
           knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

44:022:030 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
           wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his
           bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council
           to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

44:023:001 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
           brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until
           this day.

44:023:002 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him
           to smite him on the mouth.

44:023:003 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited
           wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and
           commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?

44:023:004 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?

44:023:005 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
           priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the
           ruler of thy people.

44:023:006 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and
           the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and
           brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope
           and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.

44:023:007 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
           Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

44:023:008 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
           angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

44:023:009 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
           Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in
           this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let
           us not fight against God.

44:023:010 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
           fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them,
           commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force
           from among them, and to bring him into the castle.

44:023:011 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
           good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in
           Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

44:023:012 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
           bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither
           eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

44:023:013 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

44:023:014 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We
           have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat
           nothing until we have slain Paul.

44:023:015 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
           that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would
           enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or
           ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

44:023:016 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he
           went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

44:023:017 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said,
           Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a
           certain thing to tell him.

44:023:018 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and
           said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to
           bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto
           thee.

44:023:019 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
           aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell
           me?

44:023:020 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
           wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though
           they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

44:023:021 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
           of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with
           an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have
           killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from
           thee.

44:023:022 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and
           charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these
           things to me.

44:023:023 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
           hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore
           and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the
           night;

44:023:024 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring
           him safe unto Felix the governor.

44:023:025 And he wrote a letter after this manner:

44:023:026 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth
           greeting.

44:023:027 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
           them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having
           understood that he was a Roman.

44:023:028 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
           him, I brought him forth into their council:

44:023:029 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but
           to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of
           bonds.

44:023:030 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the
           man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his
           accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.
           Farewell.

44:023:031 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
           brought him by night to Antipatris.

44:023:032 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
           returned to the castle:

44:023:033 Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to
           the governor, presented Paul also before him.

44:023:034 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
           province he was. And when he understood that he was of
           Cilicia;

44:023:035 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
           And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

44:024:001 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
           elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who
           informed the governor against Paul.

44:024:002 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
           saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that
           very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,

44:024:003 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with
           all thankfulness.

44:024:004 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
           pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few
           words.

44:024:005 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
           sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
           ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

44:024:006 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
           and would have judged according to our law.

44:024:007 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
           violence took him away out of our hands,

44:024:008 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of
           whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
           whereof we accuse him.

44:024:009 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

44:024:010 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
           speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of
           many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully
           answer for myself:

44:024:011 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
           twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

44:024:012 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any
           man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues,
           nor in the city:

44:024:013 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

44:024:014 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
           call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all
           things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

44:024:015 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
           that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
           just and unjust.

44:024:016 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
           void to offence toward God, and toward men.

44:024:017 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
           offerings.

44:024:018 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
           temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

44:024:019 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
           had ought against me.

44:024:020 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
           doing in me, while I stood before the council,

44:024:021 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
           them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in
           question by you this day.

44:024:022 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect
           knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias
           the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost
           of your matter.

44:024:023 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
           liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to
           minister or come unto him.

44:024:024 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife
           Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him
           concerning the faith in Christ.

44:024:025 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
           to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this
           time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

44:024:026 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
           that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the
           oftener, and communed with him.

44:024:027 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and
           Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

44:025:001 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days
           he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

44:025:002 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
           against Paul, and besought him,

44:025:003 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to
           Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.

44:025:004 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
           that he himself would depart shortly thither.

44:025:005 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
           with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in
           him.

44:025:006 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
           down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment
           seat commanded Paul to be brought.

44:025:007 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
           stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints
           against Paul, which they could not prove.

44:025:008 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
           Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have
           I offended any thing at all.

44:025:009 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul,
           and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
           these things before me?

44:025:010 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I
           ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou
           very well knowest.

44:025:011 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
           death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these
           things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto
           them. I appeal unto Caesar.

44:025:012 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
           Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

44:025:013 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
           Caesarea to salute Festus.

44:025:014 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's
           cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in
           bonds by Felix:

44:025:015 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
           elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment
           against him.

44:025:016 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
           deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have
           the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for
           himself concerning the crime laid against him.

44:025:017 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on
           the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man
           to be brought forth.

44:025:018 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
           accusation of such things as I supposed:

44:025:019 But had certain questions against him of their own
           superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul
           affirmed to be alive.

44:025:020 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
           whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
           matters.

44:025:021 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
           Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to
           Caesar.

44:025:022 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man
           myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

44:025:023 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
           great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with
           the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus'
           commandment Paul was brought forth.

44:025:024 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
           present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude
           of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also
           here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

44:025:025 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of
           death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have
           determined to send him.

44:025:026 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
           Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
           before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I
           might have somewhat to write.

44:025:027 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
           withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

44:026:001 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
           thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
           himself:

44:026:002 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
           myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I
           am accused of the Jews:

44:026:003 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
           questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee
           to hear me patiently.

44:026:004 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
           mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

44:026:005 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
           after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a
           Pharisee.

44:026:006 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
           of God, unto our fathers:

44:026:007 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God
           day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king
           Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

44:026:008 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
           should raise the dead?

44:026:009 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
           contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

44:026:010 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
           did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the
           chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my
           voice against them.

44:026:011 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
           to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I
           persecuted them even unto strange cities.

44:026:012 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
           from the chief priests,

44:026:013 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
           the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them
           which journeyed with me.

44:026:014 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
           speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
           why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
           the pricks.

44:026:015 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
           thou persecutest.

44:026:016 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
           thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
           both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things
           in the which I will appear unto thee;

44:026:017 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
           whom now I send thee,

44:026:018 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
           and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
           forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
           sanctified by faith that is in me.

44:026:019 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
           heavenly vision:

44:026:020 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
           throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles,
           that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
           repentance.

44:026:021 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
           about to kill me.

44:026:022 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
           day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other
           things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should
           come:

44:026:023 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
           that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the
           people, and to the Gentiles.

44:026:024 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
           voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make
           thee mad.

44:026:025 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
           the words of truth and soberness.

44:026:026 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
           freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are
           hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

44:026:027 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
           believest.

44:026:028 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
           Christian.

44:026:029 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also
           all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether
           such as I am, except these bonds.

44:026:030 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
           governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:

44:026:031 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
           saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

44:026:032 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
           liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

44:027:001 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
           they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named
           Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.

44:027:002 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
           to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian
           of Thessalonica, being with us.

44:027:003 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
           entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to
           refresh himself.

44:027:004 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
           because the winds were contrary.

44:027:005 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
           we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

44:027:006 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
           into Italy; and he put us therein.

44:027:007 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
           over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed
           under Crete, over against Salmone;

44:027:008 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
           fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

44:027:009 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now
           dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul
           admonished them,

44:027:010 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be
           with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship,
           but also of our lives.

44:027:011 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner
           of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

44:027:012 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the
           more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they
           might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an
           haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north
           west.

44:027:013 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
           obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by
           Crete.

44:027:014 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
           called Euroclydon.

44:027:015 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
           wind, we let her drive.

44:027:016 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
           had much work to come by the boat:

44:027:017 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
           the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the
           quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

44:027:018 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
           they lightened the ship;

44:027:019 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling
           of the ship.

44:027:020 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
           small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was
           then taken away.

44:027:021 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
           them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and
           not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and
           loss.

44:027:022 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be
           no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.

44:027:023 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
           and whom I serve,

44:027:024 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar:
           and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

44:027:025 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
           shall be even as it was told me.

44:027:026 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

44:027:027 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up
           and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they
           drew near to some country;

44:027:028 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had
           gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it
           fifteen fathoms.

44:027:029 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
           four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

44:027:030 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
           they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as
           though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,

44:027:031 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
           abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.

44:027:032 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
           fall off.

44:027:033 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to
           take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
           tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.

44:027:034 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
           health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any
           of you.

44:027:035 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
           God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he
           began to eat.

44:027:036 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some
           meat.

44:027:037 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
           sixteen souls.

44:027:038 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
           cast out the wheat into the sea.

44:027:039 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they
           discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they
           were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.

44:027:040 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
           themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and
           hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.

44:027:041 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
           aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
           but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.

44:027:042 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any
           of them should swim out, and escape.

44:027:043 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
           purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast
           themselves first into the sea, and get to land:

44:027:044 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the
           ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
           land.

44:028:001 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
           called Melita.

44:028:002 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for
           they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
           present rain, and because of the cold.

44:028:003 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them
           on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened
           on his hand.

44:028:004 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his
           hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a
           murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance
           suffereth not to live.

44:028:005 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

44:028:006 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen
           down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while,
           and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and
           said that he was a god.

44:028:007 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
           island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us
           three days courteously.

44:028:008 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
           fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and
           prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

44:028:009 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
           island, came, and were healed:

44:028:010 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
           they laded us with such things as were necessary.

44:028:011 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
           which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and
           Pollux.

44:028:012 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

44:028:013 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
           after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
           Puteoli:

44:028:014 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
           seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

44:028:015 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
           meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom
           when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

44:028:016 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
           prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered
           to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

44:028:017 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
           chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together,
           he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
           nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was
           I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
           Romans.

44:028:018 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
           there was no cause of death in me.

44:028:019 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to
           appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation
           of.

44:028:020 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you,
           and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I
           am bound with this chain.

44:028:021 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
           Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
           shewed or spake any harm of thee.

44:028:022 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
           concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken
           against.

44:028:023 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
           into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
           kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of
           the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till
           evening.

44:028:024 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
           believed not.

44:028:025 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
           after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost
           by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

44:028:026 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
           and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
           perceive:

44:028:027 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
           are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest
           they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
           understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
           should heal them.

44:028:028 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
           sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.

44:028:029 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
           great reasoning among themselves.

44:028:030 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
           received all that came in unto him,

44:028:031 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
           concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
           forbidding him.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.
