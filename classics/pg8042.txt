Book 42        Luke

42:001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
           declaration of those things which are most surely believed
           among us,

42:001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
           were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

42:001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
           all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
           most excellent Theophilus,

42:001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
           thou hast been instructed.

42:001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
           priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife
           was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

42:001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
           commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

42:001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
           they both were now well stricken in years.

42:001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's
           office before God in the order of his course,

42:001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to
           burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

42:001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at
           the time of incense.

42:001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
           the right side of the altar of incense.

42:001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
           upon him.

42:001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
           prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
           and thou shalt call his name John.

42:001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
           at his birth.

42:001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
           drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled
           with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

42:001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
           their God.

42:001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
           to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
           disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
           prepared for the Lord.

42:001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
           for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

42:001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
           stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
           and to shew thee these glad tidings.

42:001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until
           the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
           believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
           season.

42:001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
           tarried so long in the temple.

42:001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
           perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
           beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.

42:001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
           ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

42:001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
           herself five months, saying,

42:001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked
           on me, to take away my reproach among men.

42:001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
           unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

42:001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
           house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

42:001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
           highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
           women.

42:001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast
           in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

42:001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
           found favour with God.

42:001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
           a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

42:001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
           and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
           David:

42:001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
           his kingdom there shall be no end.

42:001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
           know not a man?

42:001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
           come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
           thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
           thee shall be called the Son of God.

42:001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
           son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
           was called barren.

42:001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

42:001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
           according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

42:001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
           with haste, into a city of Juda;

42:001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted
           Elisabeth.

42:001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
           of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
           with the Holy Ghost:

42:001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
           thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

42:001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
           come to me?

42:001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
           mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

42:001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
           performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

42:001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

42:001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

42:001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
           behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

42:001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
           is his name.

42:001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
           generation.

42:001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
           proud in the imagination of their hearts.

42:001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them
           of low degree.

42:001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
           hath sent empty away.

42:001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his
           mercy;

42:001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
           ever.

42:001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
           her own house.

42:001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
           and she brought forth a son.

42:001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
           shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

42:001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
           circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
           name of his father.

42:001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
           called John.

42:001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
           called by this name.

42:001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him
           called.

42:001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name
           is John. And they marvelled all.

42:001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,
           and he spake, and praised God.

42:001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
           these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
           country of Judaea.

42:001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
           saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of
           the Lord was with him.

42:001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
           prophesied, saying,

42:001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
           redeemed his people,

42:001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of
           his servant David;

42:001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
           since the world began:

42:001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
           all that hate us;

42:001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember
           his holy covenant;

42:001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

42:001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
           the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

42:001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
           life.

42:001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
           for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
           ways;

42:001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
           remission of their sins,

42:001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
           from on high hath visited us,

42:001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
           of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

42:001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
           deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

42:002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
           decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
           taxed.

42:002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
           Syria.)

42:002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

42:002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
           Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called
           Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

42:002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with
           child.

42:002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
           accomplished that she should be delivered.

42:002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
           swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
           no room for them in the inn.

42:002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
           field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

42:002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
           of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

42:002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
           you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

42:002:011 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
           which is Christ the Lord.

42:002:012 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
           wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

42:002:013 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
           heavenly host praising God, and saying,

42:002:014 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
           toward men.

42:002:015 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
           into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
           even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
           which the Lord hath made known unto us.

42:002:016 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
           babe lying in a manger.

42:002:017 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
           which was told them concerning this child.

42:002:018 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
           told them by the shepherds.

42:002:019 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her
           heart.

42:002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
           all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told
           unto them.

42:002:021 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of
           the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
           the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

42:002:022 And when the days of her purification according to the law of
           Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
           present him to the Lord;

42:002:023 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that
           openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

42:002:024 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
           the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young
           pigeons.

42:002:025 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
           Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
           consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

42:002:026 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
           not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

42:002:027 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the
           parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the
           custom of the law,

42:002:028 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

42:002:029 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
           to thy word:

42:002:030 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

42:002:031 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

42:002:032 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
           Israel.

42:002:033 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
           spoken of him.

42:002:034 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,
           Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
           many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

42:002:035 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that
           the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

42:002:036 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
           of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived
           with an husband seven years from her virginity;

42:002:037 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
           departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
           prayers night and day.

42:002:038 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
           Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption
           in Jerusalem.

42:002:039 And when they had performed all things according to the law of
           the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city
           Nazareth.

42:002:040 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
           wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

42:002:041 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
           the passover.

42:002:042 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
           after the custom of the feast.

42:002:043 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the
           child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his
           mother knew not of it.

42:002:044 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a
           day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and
           acquaintance.

42:002:045 And when they found him not, they turned back again to
           Jerusalem, seeking him.

42:002:046 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in
           the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
           them, and asking them questions.

42:002:047 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
           and answers.

42:002:048 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
           unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
           father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

42:002:049 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye
           not that I must be about my Father's business?

42:002:050 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

42:002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
           subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in
           her heart.

42:002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
           God and man.

42:003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
           Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being
           tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of
           Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
           tetrarch of Abilene,

42:003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
           came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

42:003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
           baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

42:003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the
           prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
           Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

42:003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
           shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,
           and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

42:003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

42:003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
           of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee
           from the wrath to come?

42:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
           not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
           for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
           up children unto Abraham.

42:003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
           tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
           down, and cast into the fire.

42:003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

42:003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let
           him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
           him do likewise.

42:003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
           Master, what shall we do?

42:003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is
           appointed you.

42:003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
           shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
           neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

42:003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
           their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

42:003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with
           water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
           shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with
           the Holy Ghost and with fire:

42:003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
           floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the
           chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

42:003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
           people.

42:003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
           brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had
           done,

42:003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

42:003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
           Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

42:003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
           upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
           my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

42:003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
           (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of
           Heli,

42:003:024 Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which
           was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was
           the son of Joseph,

           which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which
           was the son of Juda,

           was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel,
           which was the son of Neri,

42:003:028 Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which
           was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was
           the son of Er,

42:003:029 Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which
           was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was
           the son of Levi,

42:003:030 Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which
           was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was
           the son of Eliakim,

42:003:031 Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which
           was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which
           was the son of David,

42:003:032 Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which
           was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was
           the son of Naasson,

42:003:033 Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram,
           which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which
           was the son of Juda,

42:003:034 Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which
           was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was
           the son of Nachor,

42:003:035 Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which
           was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was
           the son of Sala,

42:003:036 Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad,
           which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was
           the son of Lamech,

42:003:037 Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch,
           which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel,
           which was the son of Cainan,

42:003:038 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which
           was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

42:004:001 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,
           and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

42:004:002 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
           did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward
           hungered.

42:004:003 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
           command this stone that it be made bread.

42:004:004 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
           not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

42:004:005 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed
           unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

42:004:006 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
           and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to
           whomsoever I will I give it.

42:004:007 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

42:004:008 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,
           Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
           and him only shalt thou serve.

42:004:009 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of
           the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast
           thyself down from hence:

42:004:010 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,
           to keep thee:

42:004:011 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
           thou dash thy foot against a stone.

42:004:012 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not
           tempt the Lord thy God.

42:004:013 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
           from him for a season.

42:004:014 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:
           and there went out a fame of him through all the region round
           about.

42:004:015 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

42:004:016 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
           his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
           and stood up for to read.

42:004:017 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
           Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place
           where it was written,

42:004:018 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
           to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
           brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
           recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
           are bruised,

42:004:019 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

42:004:020 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,
           and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the
           synagogue were fastened on him.

42:004:021 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
           fulfilled in your ears.

42:004:022 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
           which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this
           Joseph's son?

42:004:023 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
           proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard
           done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

42:004:024 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in
           his own country.

42:004:025 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
           days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
           months, when great famine was throughout all the land;

42:004:026 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
           city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.

42:004:027 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
           prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the
           Syrian.

42:004:028 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
           were filled with wrath,

42:004:029 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
           the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
           might cast him down headlong.

42:004:030 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

42:004:031 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them
           on the sabbath days.

42:004:032 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was
           with power.

42:004:033 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
           unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

42:004:034 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
           of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
           art; the Holy One of God.

42:004:035 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
           him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came
           out of him, and hurt him not.

42:004:036 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
           What a word is this! for with authority and power he
           commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

42:004:037 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
           round about.

42:004:038 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
           house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;
           and they besought him for her.

42:004:039 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:
           and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

42:004:040 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
           divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
           on every one of them, and healed them.

42:004:041 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou
           art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them
           not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

42:004:042 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
           and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,
           that he should not depart from them.

42:004:043 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
           other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

42:004:044 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

42:005:001 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to
           hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

42:005:002 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were
           gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

42:005:003 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
           prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land.
           And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.

42:005:004 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
           into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

42:005:005 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
           the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
           will let down the net.

42:005:006 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude
           of fishes: and their net brake.

42:005:007 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
           ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
           filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

42:005:008 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
           Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

42:005:009 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the
           draught of the fishes which they had taken:

42:005:010 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
           were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;
           from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

42:005:011 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
           all, and followed him.

42:005:012 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
           man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and
           besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
           clean.

42:005:013 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be
           thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

42:005:014 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to
           the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses
           commanded, for a testimony unto them.

42:005:015 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and
           great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by
           him of their infirmities.

42:005:016 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

42:005:017 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
           there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which
           were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and
           Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

42:005:018 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
           palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him
           before him.

42:005:019 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him
           in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and
           let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst
           before Jesus.

42:005:020 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins
           are forgiven thee.

42:005:021 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who
           is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but
           God alone?

42:005:022 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said
           unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

42:005:023 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to
           say, Rise up and walk?

42:005:024 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth
           to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say
           unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine
           house.

42:005:025 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that
           whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

42:005:026 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were
           filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

42:005:027 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,
           named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto
           him, Follow me.

42:005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

42:005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there
           was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down
           with them.

42:005:030 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his
           disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and
           sinners?

42:005:031 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need
           not a physician; but they that are sick.

42:005:032 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

42:005:033 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast
           often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the
           Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

42:005:034 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the
           bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

42:005:035 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
           away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

42:005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece
           of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new
           maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new
           agreeth not with the old.

42:005:037 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new
           wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles
           shall perish.

42:005:038 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
           preserved.

42:005:039 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new:
           for he saith, The old is better.

42:006:001 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,
           that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples
           plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their
           hands.

42:006:002 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that
           which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

42:006:003 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as
           this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they
           which were with him;

42:006:004 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
           shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it
           is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

42:006:005 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the
           sabbath.

42:006:006 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered
           into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right
           hand was withered.

42:006:007 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
           heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation
           against him.

42:006:008 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
           withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he
           arose and stood forth.

42:006:009 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it
           lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
           life, or to destroy it?

42:006:010 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
           Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
           restored whole as the other.

42:006:011 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with
           another what they might do to Jesus.

42:006:012 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
           mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

42:006:013 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of
           them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

42:006:014 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother,
           James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

42:006:015 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
           called Zelotes,

42:006:016 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also
           was the traitor.

42:006:017 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
           company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out
           of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre
           and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their
           diseases;

42:006:018 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
           healed.

42:006:019 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
           virtue out of him, and healed them all.

42:006:020 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed
           be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

42:006:021 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.
           Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

42:006:022 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
           separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and
           cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

42:006:023 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
           reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their
           fathers unto the prophets.

42:006:024 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
           consolation.

42:006:025 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
           that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

42:006:026 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
           their fathers to the false prophets.

42:006:027 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to
           them which hate you,

42:006:028 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which
           despitefully use you.

42:006:029 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
           other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take
           thy coat also.

42:006:030 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
           away thy goods ask them not again.

42:006:031 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
           likewise.

42:006:032 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
           sinners also love those that love them.

42:006:033 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank
           have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

42:006:034 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
           have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much
           again.

42:006:035 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
           nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be
           the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the
           unthankful and to the evil.

42:006:036 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

42:006:037 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
           shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

42:006:038 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
           down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
           into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal
           it shall be measured to you again.

42:006:039 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the
           blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

42:006:040 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
           perfect shall be as his master.

42:006:041 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
           but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

42:006:042 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull
           out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
           not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast
           out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou
           see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

42:006:043 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth
           a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

42:006:044 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
           not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

42:006:045 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
           forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
           treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for
           of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

42:006:046 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
           say?

42:006:047 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
           them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

42:006:048 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and
           laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
           stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake
           it: for it was founded upon a rock.

42:006:049 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without
           a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the
           stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
           ruin of that house was great.

42:007:001 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
           people, he entered into Capernaum.

42:007:002 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
           sick, and ready to die.

42:007:003 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
           Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

42:007:004 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly,
           saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

42:007:005 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

42:007:006 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
           the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
           Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou
           shouldest enter under my roof:

42:007:007 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:
           but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

42:007:008 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me
           soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to
           another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and
           he doeth it.

42:007:009 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned
           him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say
           unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

42:007:010 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
           servant whole that had been sick.

42:007:011 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
           called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much
           people.

42:007:012 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
           was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and
           she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

42:007:013 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
           unto her, Weep not.

42:007:014 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
           still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

42:007:015 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
           delivered him to his mother.

42:007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
           That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath
           visited his people.

42:007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
           throughout all the region round about.

42:007:018 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

42:007:019 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
           Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
           another?

42:007:020 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
           sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or
           look we for another?

42:007:021 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
           plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he
           gave sight.

42:007:022 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell
           John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind
           see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
           the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

42:007:023 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

42:007:024 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
           speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into
           the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

42:007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
           raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and
           live delicately, are in kings' courts.

42:007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
           you, and much more than a prophet.

42:007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
           before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

42:007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
           is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
           least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

42:007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,
           justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

42:007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God
           against themselves, being not baptized of him.

42:007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of
           this generation? and to what are they like?

42:007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
           calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,
           and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have
           not wept.

42:007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
           wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

42:007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold
           a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
           sinners!

42:007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.

42:007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
           him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to
           meat.

42:007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
           knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
           an alabaster box of ointment,

42:007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
           his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
           head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
           ointment.

42:007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
           within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
           have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
           him: for she is a sinner.

42:007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to
           say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

42:007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
           owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

42:007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
           both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

42:007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
           most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

42:007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
           this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no
           water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and
           wiped them with the hairs of her head.

42:007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
           in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

42:007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
           anointed my feet with ointment.

42:007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
           forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
           the same loveth little.

42:007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

42:007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
           themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

42:007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
           peace.

42:008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every
           city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of
           the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

42:008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
           infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven
           devils,

42:008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and
           many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

42:008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to
           him out of every city, he spake by a parable:

42:008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
           by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
           air devoured it.

42:008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
           withered away, because it lacked moisture.

42:008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
           and choked it.

42:008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
           an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
           He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

42:008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
           be?

42:008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
           kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
           might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

42:008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

42:008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
           devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
           should believe and be saved.

42:008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the
           word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
           believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

42:008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
           have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
           pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

42:008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
           good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth
           fruit with patience.

42:008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a
           vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a
           candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.

42:008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;
           neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come
           abroad.

42:008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him
           shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be
           taken even that which he seemeth to have.

42:008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not
           come at him for the press.

42:008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy
           brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

42:008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren
           are these which hear the word of God, and do it.

42:008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
           with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto
           the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

42:008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm
           of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were
           in jeopardy.

42:008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,
           we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging
           of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

42:008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
           afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
           this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they
           obey him.

42:008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
           over against Galilee.

42:008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city
           a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no
           clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

42:008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
           with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
           thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

42:008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
           man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
           with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was
           driven of the devil into the wilderness.)

42:008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,
           Legion: because many devils were entered into him.

42:008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
           into the deep.

42:008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
           mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to
           enter into them. And he suffered them.

42:008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the
           swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the
           lake, and were choked.

42:008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
           and told it in the city and in the country.

42:008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
           and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed,
           sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
           and they were afraid.

42:008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
           possessed of the devils was healed.

42:008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
           about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken
           with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned
           back again.

42:008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
           that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

42:008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath
           done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout
           the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

42:008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
           gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

42:008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
           of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
           besought him that he would come into his house:

42:008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
           she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

42:008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
           spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed
           of any,

42:008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
           immediately her issue of blood stanched.

42:008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
           they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng
           thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

42:008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that
           virtue is gone out of me.

42:008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came
           trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
           before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and
           how she was healed immediately.

42:008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
           hath made thee whole; go in peace.

42:008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
           synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
           trouble not the Master.

42:008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
           believe only, and she shall be made whole.

42:008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
           save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother
           of the maiden.

42:008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is
           not dead, but sleepeth.

42:008:053 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

42:008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
           saying, Maid, arise.

42:008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
           commanded to give her meat.

42:008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
           should tell no man what was done.

42:009:001 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them
           power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

42:009:002 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
           sick.

42:009:003 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
           staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have
           two coats apiece.

42:009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
           depart.

42:009:005 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that
           city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony
           against them.

42:009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
           gospel, and healing every where.

42:009:007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and
           he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John
           was risen from the dead;

42:009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one
           of the old prophets was risen again.

42:009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom
           I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

42:009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that
           they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into
           a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

42:009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he
           received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and
           healed them that had need of healing.

42:009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
           said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
           the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get
           victuals: for we are here in a desert place.

42:009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
           have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
           go and buy meat for all this people.

42:009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
           disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

42:009:015 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

42:009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
           up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the
           disciples to set before the multitude.

42:009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up
           of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

42:009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
           were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
           that I am?

42:009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;
           and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

42:009:020 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
           said, The Christ of God.

42:009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no
           man that thing;

42:009:022 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be
           rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
           slain, and be raised the third day.

42:009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let
           him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

42:009:024 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
           will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

42:009:025 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
           lose himself, or be cast away?

42:009:026 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
           shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
           glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

42:009:027 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
           shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

42:009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
           he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
           to pray.

42:009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,
           and his raiment was white and glistering.

42:009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses
           and Elias:

42:009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he
           should accomplish at Jerusalem.

42:009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:
           and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
           that stood with him.

42:009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said
           unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us
           make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
           one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

42:009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
           them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

42:009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
           beloved Son: hear him.

42:009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
           kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those
           things which they had seen.

42:009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
           down from the hill, much people met him.

42:009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
           beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

42:009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and
           it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
           departeth from him.

42:009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
           not.

42:009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
           how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son
           hither.

42:009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
           him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
           child, and delivered him again to his father.

42:009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
           they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said
           unto his disciples,

42:009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man
           shall be delivered into the hands of men.

42:009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
           that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that
           saying.

42:009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should
           be greatest.

42:009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a
           child, and set him by him,

42:009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my
           name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
           him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
           shall be great.

42:009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
           devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth
           not with us.

42:009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
           against us is for us.

42:009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
           received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

42:009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and
           entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for
           him.

42:009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
           he would go to Jerusalem.

42:009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
           Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
           and consume them, even as Elias did?

42:009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what
           manner of spirit ye are of.

42:009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
           save them. And they went to another village.

42:009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
           man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
           goest.

42:009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the
           air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
           head.

42:009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer
           me first to go and bury my father.

42:009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
           and preach the kingdom of God.

42:009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me
           first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

42:009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
           plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

42:010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
           sent them two and two before his face into every city and
           place, whither he himself would come.

42:010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
           the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the
           harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

42:010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

42:010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
           by the way.

42:010:005 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
           this house.

42:010:006 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
           it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

42:010:007 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
           as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not
           from house to house.

42:010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
           such things as are set before you:

42:010:009 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
           kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

42:010:010 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,
           go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

42:010:011 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do
           wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that
           the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

42:010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that
           day for Sodom, than for that city.

42:010:013 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
           mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been
           done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in
           sackcloth and ashes.

42:010:014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
           judgment, than for you.

42:010:015 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
           thrust down to hell.

42:010:016 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
           despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
           me.

42:010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
           the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

42:010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
           heaven.

42:010:019 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
           scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
           shall by any means hurt you.

42:010:020 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
           subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
           written in heaven.

42:010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,
           O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
           things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
           babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

42:010:022 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man
           knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is,
           but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

42:010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
           Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

42:010:024 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to
           see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
           hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

42:010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,
           saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

42:010:026 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
           thou?

42:010:027 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
           all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
           strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

42:010:028 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
           thou shalt live.

42:010:029 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
           is my neighbour?

42:010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
           Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
           him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him
           half dead.

42:010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
           when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

42:010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
           looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

42:010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
           and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

42:010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
           wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,
           and took care of him.

42:010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
           gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
           and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
           repay thee.

42:010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
           him that fell among the thieves?

42:010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
           him, Go, and do thou likewise.

42:010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
           certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
           into her house.

42:010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
           feet, and heard his word.

42:010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
           and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me
           to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

42:010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
           careful and troubled about many things:

42:010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
           which shall not be taken away from her.

42:011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain
           place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,
           Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

42:011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art
           in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
           done, as in heaven, so in earth.

42:011:003 Give us day by day our daily bread.

42:011:004 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
           indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
           us from evil.

42:011:005 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
           shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend
           me three loaves;

42:011:006 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
           nothing to set before him?

42:011:007 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
           door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
           rise and give thee.

42:011:008 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
           he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
           and give him as many as he needeth.

42:011:009 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
           ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

42:011:010 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
           findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

42:011:011 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
           he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
           give him a serpent?

42:011:012 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

42:011:013 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
           children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
           Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

42:011:014 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came
           to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the
           people wondered.

42:011:015 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
           the chief of the devils.

42:011:016 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

42:011:017 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
           divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
           divided against a house falleth.

42:011:018 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
           kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through
           Beelzebub.

42:011:019 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
           cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

42:011:020 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
           kingdom of God is come upon you.

42:011:021 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
           peace:

42:011:022 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
           him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
           divideth his spoils.

42:011:023 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
           not with me scattereth.

42:011:024 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
           through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith,
           I will return unto my house whence I came out.

42:011:025 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

42:011:026 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more
           wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
           the last state of that man is worse than the first.

42:011:027 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
           of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
           is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast
           sucked.

42:011:028 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
           of God, and keep it.

42:011:029 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
           say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there
           shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

42:011:030 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
           Son of man be to this generation.

42:011:031 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
           men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from
           the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
           and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

42:011:032 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
           generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the
           preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

42:011:033 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
           place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they
           which come in may see the light.

42:011:034 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
           single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine
           eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

42:011:035 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
           darkness.

42:011:036 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
           dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
           shining of a candle doth give thee light.

42:011:037 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
           him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

42:011:038 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not
           first washed before dinner.

42:011:039 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
           outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is
           full of ravening and wickedness.

42:011:040 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
           which is within also?

42:011:041 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,
           all things are clean unto you.

42:011:042 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
           manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:
           these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
           undone.

42:011:043 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in
           the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

42:011:044 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
           graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are
           not aware of them.

42:011:045 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
           thus saying thou reproachest us also.

42:011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men
           with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not
           the burdens with one of your fingers.

42:011:047 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
           your fathers killed them.

42:011:048 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
           for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

42:011:049 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them
           prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and
           persecute:

42:011:050 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
           foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

42:011:051 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which
           perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto
           you, It shall be required of this generation.

42:011:052 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
           knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
           entering in ye hindered.

42:011:053 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
           Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to
           speak of many things:

42:011:054 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his
           mouth, that they might accuse him.

42:012:001 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
           innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one
           upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,
           Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

42:012:002 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
           neither hid, that shall not be known.

42:012:003 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard
           in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
           closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

42:012:004 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
           the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

42:012:005 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
           after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
           unto you, Fear him.

42:012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of
           them is forgotten before God?

42:012:007 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear
           not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

42:012:008 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,
           him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of
           God:

42:012:009 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the
           angels of God.

42:012:010 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
           shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against
           the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

42:012:011 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
           magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing
           ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

42:012:012 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
           ought to say.

42:012:013 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
           brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

42:012:014 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider
           over you?

42:012:015 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness:
           for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
           which he possesseth.

42:012:016 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
           certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

42:012:017 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
           because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?

42:012:018 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
           build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my
           goods.

42:012:019 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
           for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

42:012:020 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
           required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou
           hast provided?

42:012:021 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
           toward God.

42:012:022 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
           no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the
           body, what ye shall put on.

42:012:023 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

42:012:024 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
           neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how
           much more are ye better than the fowls?

42:012:025 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature
           one cubit?

42:012:026 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
           take ye thought for the rest?

42:012:027 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
           not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
           not arrayed like one of these.

42:012:028 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
           and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he
           clothe you, O ye of little faith?

42:012:029 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
           neither be ye of doubtful mind.

42:012:030 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
           and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

42:012:031 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
           shall be added unto you.

42:012:032 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
           to give you the kingdom.

42:012:033 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags
           which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,
           where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

42:012:034 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

42:012:035 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;

42:012:036 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when
           he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
           knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.

42:012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
           find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
           himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
           forth and serve them.

42:012:038 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
           watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

42:012:039 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
           hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have
           suffered his house to be broken through.

42:012:040 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
           hour when ye think not.

42:012:041 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable
           unto us, or even to all?

42:012:042 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
           whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give
           them their portion of meat in due season?

42:012:043 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
           find so doing.

42:012:044 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over
           all that he hath.

42:012:045 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
           coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,
           and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

42:012:046 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh
           not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut
           him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
           unbelievers.

42:012:047 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
           himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
           with many stripes.

42:012:048 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
           shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is
           given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have
           committed much, of him they will ask the more.

42:012:049 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
           already kindled?

42:012:050 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I
           straitened till it be accomplished!

42:012:051 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
           Nay; but rather division:

42:012:052 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
           three against two, and two against three.

42:012:053 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
           against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the
           daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her
           daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in
           law.

42:012:054 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out
           of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so
           it is.

42:012:055 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be
           heat; and it cometh to pass.

42:012:056 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
           earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

42:012:057 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

42:012:058 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as
           thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be
           delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the
           judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee
           into prison.

42:012:059 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
           the very last mite.

42:013:001 There were present at that season some that told him of the
           Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
           sacrifices.

42:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
           Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they
           suffered such things?

42:013:003 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
           perish.

42:013:004 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and
           slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that
           dwelt in Jerusalem?

42:013:005 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
           perish.

42:013:006 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
           planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon,
           and found none.

42:013:007 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
           three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find
           none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

42:013:008 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year
           also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

42:013:009 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou
           shalt cut it down.

42:013:010 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

42:013:011 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
           eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise
           lift up herself.

42:013:012 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
           her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

42:013:013 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
           straight, and glorified God.

42:013:014 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
           because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said
           unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to
           work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
           sabbath day.

42:013:015 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
           each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from
           the stall, and lead him away to watering?

42:013:016 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
           Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from
           this bond on the sabbath day?

42:013:017 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were
           ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious
           things that were done by him.

42:013:018 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
           whereunto shall I resemble it?

42:013:019 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast
           into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the
           fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

42:013:020 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

42:013:021 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three
           measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

42:013:022 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
           journeying toward Jerusalem.

42:013:023 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
           he said unto them,

42:013:024 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto
           you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

42:013:025 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut
           to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at
           the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall
           answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

42:013:026 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
           presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

42:013:027 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
           depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

42:013:028 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall
           see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
           the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.

42:013:029 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
           the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the
           kingdom of God.

42:013:030 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there
           are first which shall be last.

42:013:031 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
           him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

42:013:032 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I
           cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
           third day I shall be perfected.

42:013:033 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
           following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
           Jerusalem.

42:013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and
           stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have
           gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood
           under her wings, and ye would not!

42:013:035 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say
           unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye
           shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

42:014:001 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
           chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they
           watched him.

42:014:002 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
           dropsy.

42:014:003 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,
           saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

42:014:004 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him,
           and let him go;

42:014:005 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
           an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out
           on the sabbath day?

42:014:006 And they could not answer him again to these things.

42:014:007 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
           marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

42:014:008 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in
           the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be
           bidden of him;

42:014:009 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
           man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

42:014:010 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
           that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee,
           Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the
           presence of them that sit at meat with thee.

42:014:011 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
           humbleth himself shall be exalted.

42:014:012 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
           dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,
           neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also
           bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

42:014:013 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
           lame, the blind:

42:014:014 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:
           for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

42:014:015 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
           things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread
           in the kingdom of God.

42:014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
           bade many:

42:014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were
           bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.

42:014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
           said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
           needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

42:014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
           prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

42:014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I
           cannot come.

42:014:021 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then
           the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go
           out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring
           in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
           blind.

42:014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
           and yet there is room.

42:014:023 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
           and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
           filled.

42:014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
           shall taste of my supper.

42:014:025 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
           said unto them,

42:014:026 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
           and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
           his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

42:014:027 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me,
           cannot be my disciple.

42:014:028 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
           first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to
           finish it?

42:014:029 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
           to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

42:014:030 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

42:014:031 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
           not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten
           thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty
           thousand?

42:014:032 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
           ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

42:014:033 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
           that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

42:014:034 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
           shall it be seasoned?

42:014:035 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but
           men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

42:015:001 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
           hear him.

42:015:002 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
           receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

42:015:003 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

42:015:004 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of
           them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness,
           and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

42:015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
           rejoicing.

42:015:006 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
           neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
           found my sheep which was lost.

42:015:007 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
           sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
           persons, which need no repentance.

42:015:008 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
           piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
           diligently till she find it?

42:015:009 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her
           neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found
           the piece which I had lost.

42:015:010 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
           angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

42:015:011 And he said, A certain man had two sons:

42:015:012 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me
           the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
           them his living.

42:015:013 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
           and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
           substance with riotous living.

42:015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
           land; and he began to be in want.

42:015:015 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
           and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

42:015:016 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
           the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

42:015:017 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
           of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
           with hunger!

42:015:018 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
           Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

42:015:019 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of
           thy hired servants.

42:015:020 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
           great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
           ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

42:015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
           heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
           thy son.

42:015:022 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
           robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
           on his feet:

42:015:023 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
           and be merry:

42:015:024 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
           is found. And they began to be merry.

42:015:025 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
           nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

42:015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
           meant.

42:015:027 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
           killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
           sound.

42:015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
           father out, and intreated him.

42:015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
           serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
           commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
           make merry with my friends:

42:015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy
           living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

42:015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
           I have is thine.

42:015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
           thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
           found.

42:016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
           man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him
           that he had wasted his goods.

42:016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
           this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
           mayest be no longer steward.

42:016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
           lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg
           I am ashamed.

42:016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
           stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

42:016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and
           said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

42:016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,
           Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

42:016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,
           An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy
           bill, and write fourscore.

42:016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
           wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation
           wiser than the children of light.

42:016:009 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
           of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you
           into everlasting habitations.

42:016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
           much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
           much.

42:016:011 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
           mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?

42:016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another
           man's, who shall give you that which is your own?

42:016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
           one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
           despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

42:016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
           things: and they derided him.

42:016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
           before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is
           highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

42:016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
           kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

42:016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
           of the law to fail.

42:016:018 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
           committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put
           away from her husband committeth adultery.

42:016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
           fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

42:016:020 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
           at his gate, full of sores,

42:016:021 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
           rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

42:016:022 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
           the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
           was buried;

42:016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
           Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

42:016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
           send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
           and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

42:016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
           receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:
           but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

42:016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
           fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
           neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

42:016:027 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
           wouldest send him to my father's house:

42:016:028 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
           they also come into this place of torment.

42:016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
           them hear them.

42:016:030 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
           from the dead, they will repent.

42:016:031 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
           neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

42:017:001 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
           offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

42:017:002 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
           neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one
           of these little ones.

42:017:003 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
           rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

42:017:004 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
           seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
           thou shalt forgive him.

42:017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

42:017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,
           ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by
           the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey
           you.

42:017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
           will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,
           Go and sit down to meat?

42:017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
           sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
           drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

42:017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
           commanded him? I trow not.

42:017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
           are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
           done that which was our duty to do.

42:017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
           through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

42:017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten
           men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

42:017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have
           mercy on us.

42:017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
           unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,
           they were cleansed.

42:017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
           and with a loud voice glorified God,

42:017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and
           he was a Samaritan.

42:017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
           where are the nine?

42:017:018 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
           this stranger.

42:017:019 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
           thee whole.

42:017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
           God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God
           cometh not with observation:

42:017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
           the kingdom of God is within you.

42:017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
           shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
           shall not see it.

42:017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
           after them, nor follow them.

42:017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
           under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so
           shall also the Son of man be in his day.

42:017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
           generation.

42:017:026 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
           days of the Son of man.

42:017:027 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
           in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
           the flood came, and destroyed them all.

42:017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
           drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

42:017:029 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
           brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

42:017:030 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
           revealed.

42:017:031 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
           stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and
           he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

42:017:032 Remember Lot's wife.

42:017:033 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
           whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

42:017:034 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;
           the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

42:017:035 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
           and the other left.

42:017:036 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
           other left.

42:017:037 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
           unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
           gathered together.

42:018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
           always to pray, and not to faint;

42:018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
           neither regarded man:

42:018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,
           saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

42:018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
           himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

42:018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest
           by her continual coming she weary me.

42:018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

42:018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
           night unto him, though he bear long with them?

42:018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
           when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

42:018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
           themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

42:018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
           and the other a publican.

42:018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
           thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
           adulterers, or even as this publican.

42:018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

42:018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
           as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
           God be merciful to me a sinner.

42:018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
           than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
           abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

42:018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
           them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

42:018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little
           children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
           the kingdom of God.

42:018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
           of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

42:018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall
           I do to inherit eternal life?

42:018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is
           good, save one, that is, God.

42:018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
           kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy
           father and thy mother.

42:018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

42:018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
           lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and
           distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
           heaven: and come, follow me.

42:018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
           rich.

42:018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
           hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
           God!

42:018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,
           than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

42:018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

42:018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are
           possible with God.

42:018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

42:018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
           that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or
           children, for the kingdom of God's sake,

42:018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and
           in the world to come life everlasting.

42:018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
           we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
           prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

42:018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
           mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

42:018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the
           third day he shall rise again.

42:018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
           hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

42:018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
           certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

42:018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

42:018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

42:018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
           me.

42:018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
           his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
           have mercy on me.

42:018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
           when he was come near, he asked him,

42:018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
           Lord, that I may receive my sight.

42:018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath
           saved thee.

42:018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
           glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave
           praise unto God.

42:019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

42:019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
           chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

42:019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
           press, because he was little of stature.

42:019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
           him: for he was to pass that way.

42:019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
           and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
           to day I must abide at thy house.

42:019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

42:019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
           gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

42:019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
           half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any
           thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
           fourfold.

42:019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
           house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

42:019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
           lost.

42:019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
           because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought
           that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

42:019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country
           to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

42:019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
           and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

42:019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
           saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

42:019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having
           received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
           called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might
           know how much every man had gained by trading.

42:019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
           pounds.

42:019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou
           hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over
           ten cities.

42:019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
           pounds.

42:019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

42:019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
           which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

42:019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou
           takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou
           didst not sow.

42:019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
           thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
           man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did
           not sow:

42:019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at
           my coming I might have required mine own with usury?

42:019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,
           and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

42:019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

42:019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be
           given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be
           taken away from him.

42:019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign
           over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

42:019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
           Jerusalem.

42:019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
           Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two
           of his disciples,

42:019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which
           at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never
           man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.

42:019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
           unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

42:019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he
           had said unto them.

42:019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said
           unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

42:019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

42:019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments
           upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

42:019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

42:019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
           mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
           rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty
           works that they had seen;

42:019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
           Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

42:019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
           him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

42:019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
           should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

42:019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
           it,

42:019:042 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
           day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are
           hid from thine eyes.

42:019:043 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
           cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
           thee in on every side,

42:019:044 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
           within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
           another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

42:019:045 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
           sold therein, and them that bought;

42:019:046 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of
           prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.

42:019:047 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and
           the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

42:019:048 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were
           very attentive to hear him.

42:020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught
           the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief
           priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

42:020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
           thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

42:020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one
           thing; and answer me:

42:020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

42:020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
           From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

42:020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for
           they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

42:020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

42:020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority
           I do these things.

42:020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain
           man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and
           went into a far country for a long time.

42:020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that
           they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the
           husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.

42:020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
           entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

42:020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
           him out.

42:020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will
           send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when
           they see him.

42:020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among
           themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him,
           that the inheritance may be ours.

42:020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
           therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

42:020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the
           vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God
           forbid.

42:020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is
           written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is
           become the head of the corner?

42:020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
           whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

42:020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
           lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they
           perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

42:020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
           themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,
           that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of
           the governor.

42:020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
           and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of
           any, but teachest the way of God truly:

42:020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

42:020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why
           tempt ye me?

42:020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They
           answered and said, Caesar's.

42:020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
           which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

42:020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:
           and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

42:020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
           there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

42:020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
           having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
           should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

42:020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
           wife, and died without children.

42:020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

42:020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
           they left no children, and died.

42:020:032 Last of all the woman died also.

42:020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
           seven had her to wife.

42:020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
           marry, and are given in marriage:

42:020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
           and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
           given in marriage:

42:020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
           angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
           resurrection.

42:020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
           when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of
           Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

42:020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
           live unto him.

42:020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
           well said.

42:020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

42:020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's
           son?

42:020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
           unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

42:020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

42:020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

42:020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his
           disciples,

42:020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
           love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
           synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

42:020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers:
           the same shall receive greater damnation.

42:021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts
           into the treasury.

42:021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
           mites.

42:021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow
           hath cast in more than they all:

42:021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
           offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
           living that she had.

42:021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with
           goodly stones and gifts, he said,

42:021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in
           the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
           shall not be thrown down.

42:021:007 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these
           things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall
           come to pass?

42:021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
           come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth
           near: go ye not therefore after them.

42:021:009 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not
           terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the
           end is not by and by.

42:021:010 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
           kingdom against kingdom:

42:021:011 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
           and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall
           there be from heaven.

42:021:012 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
           persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into
           prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
           sake.

42:021:013 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

42:021:014 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before
           what ye shall answer:

42:021:015 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
           adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

42:021:016 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
           kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be
           put to death.

42:021:017 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

42:021:018 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

42:021:019 In your patience possess ye your souls.

42:021:020 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
           know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

42:021:021 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and
           let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not
           them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

42:021:022 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
           written may be fulfilled.

42:021:023 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
           suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the
           land, and wrath upon this people.

42:021:024 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
           away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
           down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
           fulfilled.

42:021:025 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
           the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with
           perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

42:021:026 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
           those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
           heaven shall be shaken.

42:021:027 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
           power and great glory.

42:021:028 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
           lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

42:021:029 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
           the trees;

42:021:030 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves
           that summer is now nigh at hand.

42:021:031 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
           that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

42:021:032 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
           till all be fulfilled.

42:021:033 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
           away.

42:021:034 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
           overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of
           this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

42:021:035 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
           face of the whole earth.

42:021:036 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
           worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and
           to stand before the Son of man.

42:021:037 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at
           night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the
           mount of Olives.

42:021:038 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
           temple, for to hear him.

42:022:001 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
           the Passover.

42:022:002 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
           him; for they feared the people.

42:022:003 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
           number of the twelve.

42:022:004 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
           captains, how he might betray him unto them.

42:022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

42:022:006 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
           them in the absence of the multitude.

42:022:007 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
           be killed.

42:022:008 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
           passover, that we may eat.

42:022:009 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

42:022:010 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
           city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
           follow him into the house where he entereth in.

42:022:011 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
           saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
           the passover with my disciples?

42:022:012 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make
           ready.

42:022:013 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
           made ready the passover.

42:022:014 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve
           apostles with him.

42:022:015 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
           passover with you before I suffer:

42:022:016 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it
           be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

42:022:017 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
           divide it among yourselves:

42:022:018 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,
           until the kingdom of God shall come.

42:022:019 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
           unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:
           this do in remembrance of me.

42:022:020 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
           new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

42:022:021 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on
           the table.

42:022:022 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
           unto that man by whom he is betrayed!

42:022:023 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it
           was that should do this thing.

42:022:024 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should
           be accounted the greatest.

42:022:025 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
           lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them
           are called benefactors.

42:022:026 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
           him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth
           serve.

42:022:027 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
           serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as
           he that serveth.

42:022:028 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

42:022:029 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
           unto me;

42:022:030 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit
           on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

42:022:031 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
           have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

42:022:032 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when
           thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

42:022:033 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
           into prison, and to death.

42:022:034 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
           day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

42:022:035 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and
           scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

42:022:036 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
           take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword,
           let him sell his garment, and buy one.

42:022:037 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
           accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the
           transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

42:022:038 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
           unto them, It is enough.

42:022:039 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
           Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

42:022:040 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
           enter not into temptation.

42:022:041 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and
           kneeled down, and prayed,

42:022:042 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
           nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

42:022:043 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven,
           strengthening him.

42:022:044 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
           was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
           ground.

42:022:045 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his
           disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

42:022:046 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter
           into temptation.

42:022:047 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
           called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew
           near unto Jesus to kiss him.

42:022:048 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
           with a kiss?

42:022:049 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they
           said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

42:022:050 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
           off his right ear.

42:022:051 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he
           touched his ear, and healed him.

42:022:052 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
           temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come
           out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

42:022:053 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no
           hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of
           darkness.

42:022:054 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
           priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

42:022:055 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
           were set down together, Peter sat down among them.

42:022:056 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
           earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with
           him.

42:022:057 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

42:022:058 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
           also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

42:022:059 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
           affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him:
           for he is a Galilaean.

42:022:060 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
           immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

42:022:061 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter
           remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him,
           Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

42:022:062 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

42:022:063 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

42:022:064 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the
           face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote
           thee?

42:022:065 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

42:022:066 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
           chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into
           their council, saying,

42:022:067 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell
           you, ye will not believe:

42:022:068 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

42:022:069 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
           power of God.

42:022:070 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
           unto them, Ye say that I am.

42:022:071 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we
           ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

42:023:001 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto
           Pilate.

42:023:002 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
           perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
           Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

42:023:003 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?
           And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

42:023:004 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I
           find no fault in this man.

42:023:005 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the
           people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee
           to this place.

42:023:006 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
           Galilaean.

42:023:007 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's
           jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at
           Jerusalem at that time.

42:023:008 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
           desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard
           many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle
           done by him.

42:023:009 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
           nothing.

42:023:010 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
           him.

42:023:011 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
           him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to
           Pilate.

42:023:012 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:
           for before they were at enmity between themselves.

42:023:013 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
           the rulers and the people,

42:023:014 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
           perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him
           before you, have found no fault in this man touching those
           things whereof ye accuse him:

42:023:015 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
           worthy of death is done unto him.

42:023:016 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

42:023:017 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

42:023:018 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man,
           and release unto us Barabbas:

42:023:019 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,
           was cast into prison.)

42:023:020 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to
           them.

42:023:021 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

42:023:022 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
           done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore
           chastise him, and let him go.

42:023:023 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he
           might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief
           priests prevailed.

42:023:024 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

42:023:025 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
           cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered
           Jesus to their will.

42:023:026 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
           Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the
           cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

42:023:027 And there followed him a great company of people, and of
           women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

42:023:028 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
           not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

42:023:029 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
           Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the
           paps which never gave suck.

42:023:030 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
           to the hills, Cover us.

42:023:031 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be
           done in the dry?

42:023:032 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be
           put to death.

42:023:033 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
           there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the
           right hand, and the other on the left.

42:023:034 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
           they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

42:023:035 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
           derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if
           he be Christ, the chosen of God.

42:023:036 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
           him vinegar,

42:023:037 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

42:023:038 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
           Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

42:023:039 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
           saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

42:023:040 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou
           fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

42:023:041 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our
           deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

42:023:042 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest
           into thy kingdom.

42:023:043 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
           thou be with me in paradise.

42:023:044 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
           all the earth until the ninth hour.

42:023:045 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent
           in the midst.

42:023:046 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
           into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he
           gave up the ghost.

42:023:047 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
           saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

42:023:048 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
           the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

42:023:049 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
           Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

42:023:050 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and
           he was a good man, and a just:

42:023:051 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)
           he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself
           waited for the kingdom of God.

42:023:052 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

42:023:053 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
           sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was
           laid.

42:023:054 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

42:023:055 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
           after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

42:023:056 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and
           rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

42:024:001 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
           they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they
           had prepared, and certain others with them.

42:024:002 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

42:024:003 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

42:024:004 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
           behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

42:024:005 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the
           earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the
           dead?

42:024:006 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you
           when he was yet in Galilee,

42:024:007 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of
           sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

42:024:008 And they remembered his words,

42:024:009 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things
           unto the eleven, and to all the rest.

42:024:010 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of
           James, and other women that were with them, which told these
           things unto the apostles.

42:024:011 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they
           believed them not.

42:024:012 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping
           down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and
           departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

42:024:013 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village
           called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore
           furlongs.

42:024:014 And they talked together of all these things which had
           happened.

42:024:015 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
           reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

42:024:016 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

42:024:017 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
           that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

42:024:018 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
           unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
           known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

42:024:019 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
           Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in
           deed and word before God and all the people:

42:024:020 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
           condemned to death, and have crucified him.

42:024:021 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
           Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since
           these things were done.

42:024:022 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
           which were early at the sepulchre;

42:024:023 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they
           had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
           alive.

42:024:024 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
           and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw
           not.

42:024:025 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
           all that the prophets have spoken:

42:024:026 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
           into his glory?

42:024:027 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto
           them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

42:024:028 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
           made as though he would have gone further.

42:024:029 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
           toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to
           tarry with them.

42:024:030 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
           bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

42:024:031 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
           out of their sight.

42:024:032 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within
           us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to
           us the scriptures?

42:024:033 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
           found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with
           them,

42:024:034 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

42:024:035 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
           known of them in breaking of bread.

42:024:036 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
           them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

42:024:037 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
           had seen a spirit.

42:024:038 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do
           thoughts arise in your hearts?

42:024:039 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
           and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
           have.

42:024:040 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
           feet.

42:024:041 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
           unto them, Have ye here any meat?

42:024:042 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an
           honeycomb.

42:024:043 And he took it, and did eat before them.

42:024:044 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
           you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be
           fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the
           prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

42:024:045 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
           the scriptures,

42:024:046 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
           Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

42:024:047 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
           in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

42:024:048 And ye are witnesses of these things.

42:024:049 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but
           tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with
           power from on high.

42:024:050 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
           hands, and blessed them.

42:024:051 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
           them, and carried up into heaven.

42:024:052 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
           joy:

42:024:053 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
           Amen.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
