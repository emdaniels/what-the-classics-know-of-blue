PREFACE.


I am glad to be permitted thus to say, in a few words of introduction
to this well-meditated little volume, how pleasant and how profitable
an idea it must be considered to have designed and compiled a Buddhist
anthology. Selecting his cut and uncut jewels from very various
Buddhistic sources, Mr. Bowden has here supplied those who buy and use
the book with rubies and sapphires and emeralds of wisdom, compassion,
and human brotherhood, any one of which, worn on the heart, would be
sufficient to make the wearer rich beyond estimation for a day. The
author disclaims any attempt to set forth a corpus of Buddhistic
morality and doctrine, nor, indeed, would anything of the kind be
possible within such narrow limits; but I rejoice to observe how well
and faithfully his manifold extracts from the Sacred Books of India
and the East exhibit that ever-pervading tenderness of the great
Asiatic Teacher, which extended itself to all alike that live. This
compassionateness of Gautama, if nothing else had been illustrated by
the collection, would render it precious to possess and fruitful to
employ; but many another lofty tenet of the "Light" of Asia finds
illumination in some brief verse or maxim as day after day glides by;
and he who should mark the passage of the months with these simple
pages must become, I think, a better man at the year's end than at
its beginning. I recommend this compilation without hesitation or
reserve.

COMPILER'S PROEM.

E. M. BOWDEN.


In this compilation no attempt has been made to present a general view
of Buddhism as a religious or philosophical system. The aim has rather
been to turn Buddhism to account as a moral force by bringing together
a selection of its beautiful sentiments, and lofty maxims, and
particularly including some of those which inculcate mercy to the
lower animals.

On this point a far higher stand is taken by Buddhism than by
Christianity--or at any rate than by Christianity as understood and
interpreted by those who ought to know. Not only is the whole question
of our duties to the lower animals commonly ignored in Christian works
as, for instance, in the famous Imitation of Christ, and scores of
others; but, as if this were not enough, a reasoned attempt has
actually been made, on the strength of Christian teaching, to explode
the notion that animals have any right (e.g., in Moral Philosophy, by
Father Joseph Rickaby). Very different in this respect is the tone of
the average Buddhist treatise, with its earnest exhortations,
recurring as a matter of course, to show mercy on every living thing;
and this difference alone is an adequate reason for compiling a
Buddhist anthology.

In regard to the sources quoted from, considerable latitude seemed
allowable. They do not all, by any means, possess canonical authority.
But they are all distinctly Buddhist in character. The supposed dates
of the originals range from at least the third century B. C. to
medieval and later times.

Hence, it is clear that, should any one think to make use of
quotations from this work for controversial purposes, a certain degree
of caution will be necessary. The context of the passage, and the date
and the authorship of the original work, may all need to be taken into
account; while it must also be borne in mind that the religious terms,
such as "heaven" and "sin," which have to be employed in English, do
not always correspond exactly to the Buddhist conception.

Of the numerous Buddhist works which have now been translated from
some eight or ten eastern languages, the greater number, when regarded
purely as literature, occupy a very low level. At times they are so
remarkably dull and silly that the reader is inclined to ask why they
were ever translated. But the one redeeming feature in the voluminous
compositions of Buddhist writers is the boundless compassion which
they consistently inculcate.

The insertion of a passage in these pages does not necessarily imply
that the compiler accepts in its entirety the teaching it conveys.
Concerning that oft-repeated injunction, not to kill any living
creature whatsoever, we can hardly doubt that there are many cases in
which to take life, provided it is taken painlessly, not only is not
on the whole an unkindness, but is an act of beneficence. If we
sometimes give to this injunction the sense of extending our sympathy
to the lowest sentient being, and not causing pain to living creatures
while they live, we shall perhaps not be doing violence to the spirit
of mercy by which it was prompted. There are many passages in Buddhist
works which advocate preference for the spirit over the letter, or the
exercise of judgment in accepting what we are taught.

A few passages, though not many, have been included more because they
are striking or poetical than for the sake of their moral teaching.

As the references given are mostly to the Oriental origins, it is only
fair to insert here a list of the English and French translations
which have been principally used in compiling this book. The following

THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHISM.


All beings desire happiness; therefore to all extend your
benevolence.--Mahavamsa.

Because he has pity upon every living creature, therefore is a man
called "holy."--Dhammapada.

Like as a mother at the risk of her life watches over her only child,
so also let every one cultivate towards all beings a boundless
(friendly) mind.--Metta-sutta.

Hurt not others with that which pains yourself.--Udanavarga.

I cannot have pleasure while another grieves and I have power to help
him.--Jatakamala.

With pure thoughts and fulness of love, I will do towards others what
I do for myself.--Lalita Vistara.

If you desire to do something pleasing to me, then desist from hunting
forever! The poor poor beasts of the forest, being ... dull of
intellect, are worthy of pity for this very reason.--Jatakamala.

You will generously follow the impulse of pity, I hope.--Jatakamala.

    For that they hated this poor slender boy,
    That ever frowned upon their barbarous sports,
    And loved the beasts they tortured in their play,
    And wept to see the wounded hare, or doe,
    Or trout that floundered on the angler's hook.

--Lloyd "Nichiren."

Good men melt with compassion even for one who has wrought them
harm.--Kshemendra's Avadana Kalpalata.

word.--Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king.

Them who became thy murderers, thou forgavest.--Lalita Vistara.

Sections.

The member of Buddha's order ... should not intentionally destroy the
life of any being, down even to a worm or an ant.--Mahavagga.

Whether now any man kill with his own hand, or command any other to
kill, or whether he only see with pleasure the act of killing--all is
equally forbidden by this law.--Sha-mi-lu-i-yao-lio.

My teaching is this, that the slightest act of charity, even in the
lowest class of persons, such as saving the life of an insect out of
pity, that this act ... shall bring to the doer of it consequent
benefit.--T'sa-ho-hom-king.

He came to remove the sorrows of all living
things.--Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king.

exists for him who is devoted to a holy life.--Jatakamala.

Is not all I possess, even to my very body, kept for the benefit of
others?--Nagananda.

All men should cultivate a fixed and firm determination, and vow that what
they once undertake they will never give up.--Fo-pen-hing-tsih-king.

Rather will I fall headlong into hell ... than do a deed that is
unworthy.--Jataka.

May my body be ground to powder small as the mustard-seed if I ever
desire to (break my vow)!--Fo-pen-hing-tsih-king.

Happy is he that is virtuous--Dhammapada.

To make an end of selfishness is happiness.--Udanavarga.

There is no happiness except in righteousness.--Attanagalu-vansa.

Full of love for all things in the world, practicing virtue in order
to benefit others--this man only is happy.--Fa-kheu-pi-u.

He that loveth iniquity beckoneth to misfortune.--Jitsu-go-kiyo.

The higher life maketh he known, in all its purity and in all its
perfectness.--Tevijja-sutta.

loved them and harmed them not.--Sama Jataka (Burmese version).

Compassionate and kind to all creatures that have

called a religious system?... To seek a good by doing an evil is
surely no safe plan.--Fo-pen-hing-tsih-king.

    Sad pleading words, showing how man, who prays
    For mercy to the gods, is merciless.

    Purifying his intention from all selfish ends:
    This is the doctrine of all the Buddhas.

of my ... justly acquired wealth to one, to two, to three, ... to a
hundred.--Magha-sutta.

They sought their daily gain righteously; no covetous, money-loving

a thought of any reward.--Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king.

What has been designated "name" and "family" ... is but a
term.--Vasettha-sutta.

The wise man ... regards with reverence all who deserve reverence,

For if virtue flags and folly rules, what reverence can there be ...
for a high name or boast of prowess, inherited from former
generations?--Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king.

Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest
enemies, for they do evil deeds which cannot but bear bitter
fruit.--Dhammapada.

There is not a spot upon earth, neither in the sky, neither in the
sea, neither ... in the mountain-clefts, where an (evil) deed does not
bring trouble (to the doer).--Udanavarga.

   What man is there who would be remiss in doing good to mankind?

--Quoted by Max Muller.

[Footnote 2: Buddhist missionaries.]

He identified himself with all beings--Jatakamala.

    Because the dove fears the hawk,
    With fluttering pennons she comes to seek my protection.

    Yet through fear her eyes are moist.
    Now, therefore, I will extend (to this poor creature)
    My own protection and defense.

--Ta-chwang-yan-king-lun.

How indifferent he was to his own welfare!...

How intolerant of the suffering of others!--Jatakamala. In every
condition, high or low, we find folly and ignorance (and men), carelessly
following the dictates of ... passion.--Fo-sho-hing-tsan-king.

Neither is it right to judge men's character by outward
appearances.--Ta-chwang-yan-king-lun.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
